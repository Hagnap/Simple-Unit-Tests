# Simple-Unit-Tests

## Project Description
This project features very simple problems to solve but are solved using a Test Driven Development approach. So I'd create a test for a problem & think of weird cases to test to ensure the function is accurate, attempt to solve the problem, test the problem, and repeated steps 2 & 3 for all five problems. The five problems are

  1) Create a function that takes a string and returns said string with the first letter capitalized

  2)  Create a function that takes a string and returns a reversed version of string

  3)  Create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide).
        - Input is two operands and one operand

  4) Create a function that encrypts a string via a Ceasar Cipher. 
       - Only works if the shift is a positive integer (negative shifting is a WIP)

  5) Create a function that anaylzes an array of numbers. It should return an object that stores the following data about the array
       - Average
    
       - Minimum
    
       - Maximum
    
       - Length
