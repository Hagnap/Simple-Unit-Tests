# Simple-Unit-Tests

## Project Description
This project features very simple problems to solve but are solved using a Test Driven Development approach. So I'd create a test for a problem & think of weird cases to test to ensure the function is accurate, attempt to solve the problem, test the problem, and repeated steps 2 & 3 for all five problems. The five problems are

  1) Create a function that takes a string and returns said string with the first letter capitalized

  2)  Create a function that takes a string and returns a reversed version of string

  3)  Create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide).
        - Input is two operands and one operand

  4) Create a function that encrypts a string via a Ceasar Cipher. 
       - Only works if the shift is a positive integer (negative shifting is a WIP)

  5) Create a function that anaylzes an array of numbers. It should return an object that stores the following data about the array
       - Average
    
       - Minimum
    
       - Maximum
    
       - Length

## Project Link
For this one there is no link and that's by design. This can be run via the console/terminal! How exciting! All you have to do is download the repo, open the console/terminal, then navigate the repo's directory (Should be in Downloads directory unless you moved it or have a different location for your downloads... if thats a thing), once in the repo's directory run this command `npm test`. Once that is executed you will the results of the Unit Tests, pretty cool!
