# Simple-Unit-Tests

## Project Description
This project features very simple problems to solve but are solved using a Test Driven Development approach. So I'd create a test for a problem & think of weird cases to test to ensure the function is accurate, attempt to solve the problem, test the problem, and repeated steps 2 & 3 for all five problems. The five problems are

  1) Create a function that takes a string and returns said string with the first letter capitalized

  2)  Create a function that takes a string and returns a reversed version of string

  3)  Create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide).
        - Input is two operands and one operand

  4) Create a function that encrypts a string via a Ceasar Cipher. 
       - Only works if the shift is a positive integer (negative shifting is a WIP)

  5) Create a function that anaylzes an array of numbers. It should return an object that stores the following data about the array
       - Average
    
       - Minimum
    
       - Maximum
    
       - Length

## Challenges Faced

Having to stop and create tests before coding

  - This is a simple but weird adjustment. I have always created code and then checked if it worked afterwards so stopping and creating tests first was different but I can see why it's done. It does help you stop and think about the problem a bit more before getting your hands dirty. Once I created the tests for the unit I was working on I did enjoy the process of creating code, checking code, and repeating that until all tests I made were green, that felt rewarding.

How do I know I made a good test? 

  - When it comes to doing & learning new things no one is great from the start, in a sport or game you can tell you're bad when your friends tell you ( or at least for me ) but when it comes to coding I don't have any friends that code so I'm not sure if I'm creating a good test or not. Jokes aside I do want to look more into how to make a *good* unit test and dive more into the TDD realm. I like the idea of making Unit Tests but what makes a Unit Test a good Unit Test? 


## Project Link
For this one there is no link and that's by design. This can be run via the console/terminal! How exciting! All you have to do is download the repo, open the console/terminal, then navigate the repo's directory (Should be in Downloads directory unless you moved it or have a different location for your downloads... if thats a thing), once in the repo's directory run this command `npm test`. Once that is executed you will the results of the Unit Tests, pretty cool!
